# Battle Strategy FHE: The Encrypted Arena of Tactical Brilliance 🎮🔒

Battle Strategy FHE is an innovative GameFi battle arena that revolutionizes strategic gameplay through the implementation of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This game allows players to engage in a turn-based tactical slaughter where both participants simultaneously submit their FHE-encrypted strategies, enabling a fair and transparent resolution by the server. Step into a world where your strategies remain confidential, and the outcomes are rigorously fair!

## The Challenge: Tactical Transparency and Fairness ⚔️

In traditional turn-based strategy games, players often face issues of fairness and information leakage. The player who goes first holds an inherent advantage, potentially swaying the match outcome before the second player even takes a turn. Additionally, revealing strategies can lead to exploitation by opponents, undermining the competitive spirit. Such disparities create an unbalanced environment where true skill and creativity can be overshadowed by systemic flaws.

## The FHE Solution: Fair Play Through Encryption 🔍

Battle Strategy FHE addresses these challenges directly through the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Leveraging Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we enable players to submit encrypted actions. The server performs computations on these encrypted inputs without revealing them, ensuring that both players' strategies remain concealed until the round concludes. This implementation not only eliminates the first-mover advantage but also guarantees that no information is leaked during gameplay, cultivating a fair and competitive atmosphere.

## Core Features of Battle Strategy FHE 🌟

- **FHE-Encrypted Player Actions**: Each player's strategy is secured through robust encryption, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Homomorphic Calculation of Round Outcomes**: Results are computed homomorphically, revealing outcomes without disclosing individual strategies.
- **Elimination of Information Leakage**: Protects players from strategic exploitation, creating a level playing field.
- **Enhanced Competitive Experience**: Combines cutting-edge technology with engaging gameplay, ensuring that skill triumphs over tactics.
- **Futuristic Sci-Fi Theme**: Immerse yourself in a visually stunning battle arena designed with an imaginative sci-fi aesthetic.

   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Example of FHE Encrypted Action Submission 🔐

Here’s a sample snippet demonstrating how players can submit their encrypted strategies. This utilizes the Zama SDK for encryption:

```javascript
import { encryptAction, decryptOutcome } from 'zama-fhe-sdk';

// Player's action
const playerAction = "Attack";

// Encrypt the action using Zama's library
const encryptedAction = encryptAction(playerAction);

// Submit the encrypted action to the server
submitEncryptedAction(encryptedAction).then((outcome) => {
  const result = decryptOutcome(outcome); // Decrypt the result once revealed
  console.log(`Outcome of the round: ${result}`);
});
```

## Acknowledgements 🙏
